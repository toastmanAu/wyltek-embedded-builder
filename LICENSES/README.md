# Third-Party Licenses

This directory contains license files for third-party code incorporated into
wyltek-embedded-builder. Each Wy* component that wraps external code includes
the original license here, keyed by library name.

| Library | License | Used in | Source |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| *(none yet — this file is the template)* | | | |

When adding a new wrapped library:
1. Copy its LICENSE file here as `LICENSES/<libname>-LICENSE`
2. Add a row to the table above
3. Add attribution header to the Wy*.h file
